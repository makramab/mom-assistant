# Baby Development Assessment Chatbot Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a ChatGPT-style interface that helps parents assess their baby's development through natural conversation. The chatbot serves as the primary interaction point, guiding parents through development discussions and launching focused assessment tools when needed. The interface combines conversational AI with structured assessment tools to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience.

## Core Features

1. **Conversational Interface**
   - Natural language chat interface as the main interaction point
   - Context-aware responses and follow-up questions
   - Ability to understand and respond to development concerns
   - Seamless transitions between chat and assessment tools

2. **Integrated Assessment Tools**
   - Modal-based milestone questionnaires launched from chat
   - Age-appropriate development checks
   - Visual progress tracking
   - Assessment results seamlessly shared back to chat for discussion

3. **Personalized Guidance**
   - Chat-based recommendations based on conversations and assessments
   - Contextual launching of relevant resources and tools
   - Development activity suggestions through chat
   - Early intervention recommendations when needed

4. **Nutrition Support**
   - Nutrition advice through chat interface
   - Modal-based meal planning tools when needed
   - Age-appropriate feeding guidelines
   - Recipe suggestions based on nutritional needs

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Scaffold the App**  
   Prompt: `Initialize a new React project called \`mom-chat\` using Vite with the React template.`

2. **Install Styling Tools**  
   Prompt: `Install and configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS and autoprefixer.`

3. **Set Up Global Styles**  
   Prompt: `Import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities in \`src/index.css\` and ensure \`index.tsx\` imports this CSS.`

4. **Create Landing Page Layout**  
   Prompt: `Generate \`LandingPage.jsx\` highlighting the chatbot interface and its integrated assessment capabilities.`

5. **Build Chat Interface**
   Prompt: `Create \`ChatInterface.jsx\` as the main interaction point with message history, input, and modal launching capabilities.`

6. **Implement Assessment Modals**
   Prompt: `Create \`AssessmentModal.jsx\` for milestone questionnaires that can be launched from chat context.`

7. **Add Chat Logic**
   Prompt: `Implement chat flow control and context management in \`chatLogic.ts\`.`

8. **Create Assessment Logic**
   Prompt: `Build assessment evaluation and result sharing logic in \`assessmentLogic.ts\`.`

9. **Implement Nutrition Module**
   Prompt: `Add nutrition-related chat capabilities and modal-based tools in \`NutritionModule.jsx\`.`

10. **Style Components**
    Prompt: `Apply consistent styling to chat interface, modals, and assessment forms.`

11. **Enhance User Experience**
    Prompt: `Add smooth transitions, loading states, and progress indicators.`

## Expected Result

A React application that:
- Features a ChatGPT-style interface as the main interaction point
- Seamlessly integrates assessment tools through modal windows
- Maintains conversation context across different assessment activities
- Provides natural language interactions with structured assessment capabilities
- Offers a clean, professional design optimized for parent users
