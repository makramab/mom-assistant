**1. Build an Interactive Parental Nutrition-Support App**  
- **Goal:** Deliver personalized, culturally sensitive maternal & child nutrition guidance to parents.  
- **Features:**  
  - User profiling (pregnancy stage, dietary restrictions, local food availability)  
  - Adaptive lesson modules (text, video, quizzes) for both “sensitive” (e.g. breastfeeding encouragement) and “specific” (e.g. micronutrient dosing) interventions  
  - Chatbot Q&A with context-aware prompts and follow-up suggestions  
  - Progress tracking dashboard with reminders and motivational nudges  

**2. Develop a Financing & MEL Matchmaking Platform**  
- **Goal:** Connect Kader programs and cross-sector funders, while embedding a Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning framework.  
- **Features:**  
  - Funding marketplace: upload program profiles & funding opportunities, automated matching based on criteria (region, budget size, program type)  
  - MEL module: real-time data collection (surveys, activity logs), KPI dashboards, automated impact reports  
  - Feedback loops: trigger alerts for under-performing metrics, suggest course-corrections (e.g. top-up funding, training refreshers)  
  - Secure role-based access: funders, program managers, data analysts

**AI Agent Instructions:**  
“Your task is to design, specify, and prototype two digital solutions:  
1. An AI-driven parental engagement app for maternal & child nutrition that adapts content based on user data and tracks behavior change.  
2. A web platform that matches community health worker programs with funding partners and integrates a full MEL workflow—including data capture, analysis, and feedback mechanisms.”
